# horiseon-SEO-refactor

Refactoring html to create accessibility. Added alt attributes to images. Renamed elements for better semantic structure.

In adding alts to the various img elements, I came across the challenge of deciding whether or not to add alts to decorative items. At first, I was trying to add alts but realized that finding a good type of descriptor for "lightbulb head with a tie", for example, was hard to enter without thinking that it would make things more confusing for those using a screen reader. 

I have decided to leave the alts for the 3 decorative images on the right bar blank after consulting a couple of pages through Google (with a shoutout to this decision tree https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
